This repository contains my practice and progress while following AlexTheAnalyst's SQL Tutorial on YouTube. I am using **PostgreSQL** as my database system for hands-on learning.

The tutorial covers the basics of SQL and is ideal for beginners. Throughout the course, I apply the concepts using PostgreSQL and document the examples, queries, and exercises here for reference and future revision.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **DBeaver** (My preferred SQL client)
- **Git** & **GitHub** – for version control
